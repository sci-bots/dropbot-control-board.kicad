# DropBot v3 control board

The control board is a component of the [DropBot system][dropbot] responsible for:

* serial communication with the host computer (via USB)
* generation of the high-voltage driving signal (up to 140V @ < 10 kHz)
* impedance-measurement (for estimating drop position, velocity, etc.)
* control of other system hardware (e.g., switching boards)
